# Blood Cell Images with Tensorflow

Identifying and categorizing patient blood samples is a common part of diagnosing blood-based disorders. Methods for detecting and classifying blood cell subtypes that are automated have substantial medicinal implications.

12,500 augmented pictures of blood cells (JPEG) with cell type labels are included in this dataset (CSV). There are around 3,000 photos for each of the four cell types, which are organized into four folders (according to cell type). Eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils are the four cell types.
